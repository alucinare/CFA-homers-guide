# CFA-homers-guide

An intro guide to Ruby on Rails taught by Smart (or not so smrt) Homer. This was a presentation that I made to help me solidify and better understand the mechanics behind RoR. I was able to present it to my class. I choose Simpsons theme because it seemed like a good and fun idea at the time.

I wasn't sure if mac's can view the .odp format so I also saved a .pptx format as well which has a greater chance of being compatible. However, some of the transition effects may not work because it's not the native formate of LibreOffice.

I hope you have as much fun using it as I did making it.
